one-direction-stole-my-heart-
=============================

ok , so one direction 
i knew one direction only few monthes ago by my cousin , i know it's not a long while ago , but since i knew 
them they are my everything, the first thing i think about in the morning and the last thing i think about before
i sleep, i can't even remember my life before them , all their songs their personalaties , their stories ,
just everything about them, the first time i saw harry when i was chatting with my cousin and she gave me a name and 
told me to google it , YES this name was "harry stykes" , so that's what i did , i opened google and searched for 
images for him , and when i first saw him, my eyes widened and i swear i lost my breath for a few seconds, he stole
my heart, i never thought that the boy of my dreams does really exist , and then i started to search for one direction 
on google , i searched about everything and nothing, i fell in love with them all of them , there were days when
i cried, when i smiled , i laughed , and danced because of them , and tbh since i ever known them no minute ever
pass without thinking of them, ever, i tweet a lot for them, and they never reply but i don't get mad , i don't hate
them because of that, instead i always say maybe they are busy , maybe they are tired from recording or something
i know it's too long but no words in the world can ever mean how i feel about them , i know there's many girls like
me who i call them my second family , "Directioners" the only family that knows how i feel, i just want to end this 
by saying that one direction are the best thing that ever happened to me i'm so thankful :) , and i love them 
forever forever forever, and i will NEVER leave them for any reason in the world , i ADORE THEM.
with my love:
Ashley , the girl that her heart is stolen by one direction <3
